**This project is unmaintained.**

This is a serializer / deserializer library for PHP data structures, written in
C.

I reverse-engineered the behavior from a wire protocol and only later
recognized that the format was a PHP serialization format that was previously
foreign to me.

The implementation is over a decade old as of this writing, and it seems
possible that it may be completely out of date, or missing important
functionality.
